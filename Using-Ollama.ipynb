      "|6|.| **|Increased| strength| and| resilience|**:| Regular| exercise| can| help| build| physical| strength|,| endurance|,| and| resilience| â€“| not| just| in| the| body|,| but| also| in| life|.| By| pushing| yourself| outside| of| your| comfort| zone|,| you| can| develop| a| stronger| sense| of| self|-confidence| and| ability| to| handle| challenges|.\n",
